# warden-flow

`@nekwebdev/warden-flow` is Warden's Pi Agent workflow, durable-orientation, and commit-safety package.

It reduces repeated repo discovery by maintaining a small map tree, injecting only token-conscious capsules when relevant, and providing lean workflow skills plus safe local commit planning tools.

## What it provides

- `/skill:warden-map` — creates or refreshes repository map files.
- `/skill:warden-docs` — aligns stale `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` files with repo evidence when map freshness is current.
- `/skill:warden-start` — turns rough intent into one small `.warden/work/<slug>/packet.md` work packet for a lean dev cycle.
- `/skill:warden-grill` — pressure-tests a work packet or manual feedback through a question/update loop until it is solid for TDD.
- `/skill:warden-tdd` — implements one grilled work packet slice with strict test-first workflow.
- `/skill:warden-close` — validates an accepted work packet or existing closure `handoff.md`, creates or updates final `handoff.md`, and decides changelog/map impact.
- `/skill:warden-commit` — plans safe, atomic local commits and can apply them after exact `Commit` confirmation.
- `/warden:effort` — opens the Warden panel Effort pane for Warden skill thinking-level settings through `@nekwebdev/warden-panel`.
- `extensions/warden-map` — injects map capsules and git context.
- `extensions/warden-commit` — registers `warden_commit_snapshot` and `warden_commit_apply` for safe local commit planning and execution.
- `extensions/warden-effort` — seeds Warden skill effort defaults and applies configured effort before `/skill:warden-*` expansion.
- Session-start map injection — hidden root map capsule from `<git-root>/.warden/map.md`.
- Scoped map injection — hidden scoped capsules from `<git-root>/.warden/maps/<scope>/map.md` appended to relevant tool results.
- Git context injection — branch, short commit, and dirty state.

## Map layout

When cwd is inside a Git repository, maps are canonical at the Git top-level, even when Pi runs from a nested cwd:

```text
<git-root>/.warden/
├── map.md
├── map-state.json
└── maps/
    └── <repo-relative-scope>/
        └── map.md
```

Examples:

```text
.warden/map.md
.warden/map-state.json
.warden/maps/pi-warden/map.md
.warden/maps/pi-warden/warden-flow/map.md
```

Only `/skill:warden-map` writes maps and `.warden/map-state.json`. It refuses dirty Git repositories before refreshing either. The marker is rooted at the Git top-level `.warden/**`, not at nested package cwd paths.

## Capsule contract

Only marked capsules are auto-injected:

```md
<!-- warden-map:inject:start -->
## Agent Quick Context

- Purpose:
- Boundaries:
- Safe edits:
- Verification:
- Sharp edges:
<!-- warden-map:inject:end -->
```

The extension prepends freshness metadata from `.warden/map-state.json` to each injected root or scoped capsule:

```text
Freshness: fresh|stale|unknown
Map basis: <short-sha|unknown>
Current HEAD: <short-sha|unknown>
```

Freshness uses the requested map's basis SHA. Same basis and current Git HEAD is fresh; otherwise the committed diff from basis to current HEAD is fresh only when it touches map-owned paths (`.warden/map.md`, `.warden/maps/**/map.md`, or `.warden/map-state.json`). Dirty working-tree state remains separate Git context.

Full map bodies stay on disk. Agents can read them explicitly when a task needs deeper context.

## Token budget

Approximate budget rule: 1 KB markdown is about 250–350 tokens.

| Context | Target | Hard cap |
|---|---:|---:|
| Root capsule | 3 KB (~900 tokens) | 8 KB (~2,400 tokens) |
| Scoped capsule | 1.5 KB (~450 tokens) | 4 KB (~1,200 tokens) |
| One scoped injection event | — | 6 KB (~1,800 tokens) |
| Session start total | — | 10 KB (~3,000 tokens) |

When a capsule is missing or too large, the extension injects a small notice pointing at the map file instead of injecting the full file.

## Git context

When git is available, the extension injects:

```md
## Current Git Context
- Branch: main
- Commit: abc1234
- Dirty: yes — staged 1, unstaged 3, untracked 2
- Dirty paths: src/a.ts, docs/b.md
```

Git context is cached and re-injected only when branch, commit, or dirty state changes.

## Skill effort

Warden Flow stores per-skill effort settings and the skill status indicator toggle in Pi `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "warden": {
    "effort": {
      "showSkillStatus": false,
      "skills": {
        "warden-map": "low",
        "warden-start": "medium",
        "warden-grill": "high",
        "warden-tdd": "high",
        "warden-close": "medium",
        "warden-commit": "medium",
        "warden-docs": "medium"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Current defaults seeded at session start:

- `warden-map`: `low`
- `warden-start`: `medium`
- `warden-grill`: `high`
- `warden-tdd`: `high`
- `warden-close`: `medium`
- `warden-commit`: `medium`
- `warden-docs`: `medium`

`/warden:effort` opens the Effort pane contributed through the public pane API from `@nekwebdev/warden-panel`. `warden-flow` declares that package as a dependency so the pane framework is available when the Effort extension loads. Space/Enter cycles a selected skill through `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` and writes immediately; there is no Apply step.

`extensions/warden-effort` also contributes a Display pane setting for the skill status indicator through `contributeWardenDisplaySetting()`. The indicator defaults off. Toggle it from Display; the setting writes inline.

When a `/skill:warden-*` turn starts, `extensions/warden-effort` reads the configured level, calls Pi's public `setThinkingLevel()`, shows a small themed Pi status indicator with the active skill and effort level when `warden.effort.showSkillStatus` is `true` (default off), then restores the previous thinking level and clears the status indicator after the agent turn. Pi may clamp unsupported levels depending on the active model/provider.

## Close workflow

`/skill:warden-close` accepts a `packet.md` or `handoff.md` path. It validates accepted closure against packet/repo evidence, creates a missing sibling `handoff.md` when closure evidence is sufficient, leaves valid handoffs unchanged, and may update stale handoff content. It does not implement code, edit maps, stage changes, or commit changes.

Use it when accepted work needs final closure documented, or when an existing close record should be confirmed before commit planning.

## Commit helper

`/skill:warden-commit` uses `warden_commit_snapshot` from `extensions/warden-commit` to plan local commits without token-heavy repeated git inspection.

`warden_commit_snapshot` is read-only. It reports compact git status, Warden boundaries, path risks, deterministic buckets, recent commit subjects, and a stable snapshot hash. It does not stage, commit, push, pull, fetch, rebase, reset, amend, tag, or create PRs.

`warden_commit_apply` can create local commits only from an explicit plan after the user replies exactly `Commit`. It recomputes the snapshot, refuses when the hash changed, validates exact repo-relative paths, rejects risky/excluded paths by default, refuses mixed staged/unstaged or pre-existing staged changes, stages only exact paths, verifies the staged set before `git commit`, and returns commit hashes plus final `git status --short`.

It never pushes, pulls, fetches, rebases, resets, amends, tags, stashes, checks out, cleans, restores, creates PRs, or runs remote git operations.

## Package dependency

`warden-flow` depends on `@nekwebdev/warden-panel` for the Effort pane registry and panel opener used by `/warden:effort`. In this repository the dependency is declared as `file:../warden-panel` so local package development and Pi local installs resolve the sibling package explicitly.

## Scope boundary

This package owns Warden workflow/orientation Pi behavior, including `warden-map`, `warden-docs`, `warden-start`, `warden-grill`, `warden-tdd`, `warden-close`, `warden-commit`, map capsule injection, commit snapshot/apply tooling, and Warden Flow skill effort settings.

It does not own Warden runner workflows, Pi agent lifecycle commands, or sibling package installation workflows.

## Local development

```sh
npm install --prefix pi-warden/warden-panel
npm install --prefix pi-warden/warden-flow
npm test --prefix pi-warden/warden-flow
mise run test:pi-warden
```

From the Warden repo root, load temporarily during development:

```sh
pi -e ./pi-warden/warden-flow
```

Or install locally into a Pi environment:

```sh
pi install ./pi-warden/warden-flow
```
